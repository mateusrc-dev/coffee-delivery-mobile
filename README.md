# Coffee delivery app ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸš€ Application that consists of coffee delivery, where the user can place coffees in a cart and confirm their order...

#### ðŸš€ In this application the three pillars of react native reanimated were used to create the animations: useShareValue (changeable values â€‹â€‹that will be used to create the animation), useAnimatedStyle (to change the values â€‹â€‹of the style properties), Animated (to use an animated component).

### ðŸš€ Some libraries used in the application:

- react-native-async-storage/async-storage - for user to store data on device
- react-navigation/native-stack - to create application navigation - create routes
- shopify/react-native-skia - to create images and animations with these images
- native-base - lib that already has several components made that we can change to facilitate the creation of interfaces
- phosphor-react-native - lib that provides several icons to be used in the interface
- react-hook-form - to get the form data at once (different from the states where we get data from each field separately), it is also possible to create rules, put the initial data of the fields by default, insert the field typing
- react-native-gesture-handler - to be able to capture interactions/gestures with the user's screen (example: dragging right, left)
- react-native-reanimated - to create animations
- react-native-svg - to be able to insert and view svg in components

### ðŸ’» To use it on your machine, you can download the repository and run the command "npm run start" in the repository terminal (note: keep Android Studio running the Android emulator)
